    "## What is RAFT?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAFT stands for Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning. The general principle is to use a big LLM such as Llama 3.1 405B to analyse a set of documents and generate a dataset of questions and answers that users might want to ask about those documents. We can then use that QA dataset to fine tune a smaller model such as Llama 3.1 8B. The fine tune model will therefore be better at answering questions about those documents."

    "\n",
    "RAFT is a general recipe to finetune a pretrained LLM to your domain-specific RAG settings. This is a common scenario where you want your LLM to answer questions grounded on a set of documents, for e.g., private files in an enterprise. Such a setting is different from the general RAG where the LLM does not know which domain (of documents) it will be tested on. To better illustrate this setting, let's draw an analogy between deploying and using an LLM with the real-world setting of prepararing for an exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "![RAFT Open book principle](./doc/raft_openbook.png \"RAFT Open book principle\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Closed-Book Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "A closed book exam often refers to the scenario where the LLMs do not have access to any additional documents or references to answer the questions during the exam. For LLMs, this is equivalent to the scenario, for example, in which the LLM is used as a chatbot. In this scenario the LLM draws from the knowledge baked in during pre-training and supervised-finetuning to respond to the users' prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open-Book Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, we liken the open-book exam setting to the scenario in which the LLM can refer to external sources of information (e.g., a website or a book chapter). In such scenarios, typically, the LLM is paired with retriever which retrieves k documents (or specific segments of the document) which are appended to the users' prompt. It is only through these documents retrieved that the LLM gains access to new knowledge. As a result, we argue that the LLM's performance in these settings, where it is trained as a general-purpose LLM is largely dependent on the quality of the retriever and how accurately the retriever can identify the most relevant piece of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RAFT\n",
    "\n",
    "RAFT focuses on a narrower but increasingly popular domain than the general open book exam, called the domain-specific open-book exam. In domain-specific open book exam, we know a priori the domain in which the LLM will be tested --- used for inference. The LLM can respond to the users' prompt using use any and all information from this specific domain, which it has been fine-tuned on. Examples of domain specific examples include enterprise documents, latest news, code repositories belonging to an organization, etc. In all these scenarios, the LLM will be used to respond to the questions, whose answers can be found within a collection of documents (a small practical domain). The retrieval technique itself has little to no-impact on the mechanism (though it may impact the accuracy). This paper mainly studies this, domain-specific open-book setting and how to adapt a pretrained LLM to this specific domain, including how to make it more robust to a varying number of retrieved documents and distractors."
